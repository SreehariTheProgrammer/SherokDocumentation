# Sherok
### This is a python library to make python very very simpler.
### This library will be usefull to people new to programming.
### This library consists of many commands even rickroll!
### <br/>
## So, let's learn it.
### <br/>
#### For making everything easy, I would suggest you to use this method:
#### <br/>
```py
from sherok import * # pip install sherok
```
### 1) Maths (add2nums, sub2nums, mul2nums and div2nums)
#### <br/>
#### Let's see a live example of these:
#### <br/>
```py
from sherok import *
sum = add2nums(3, 8)
print(sum)
```
#### <br/>
#### Then, you will get the the result of 3+8 which is 11.
#### The 3 others are also like this, instead of addition, they can do subtraction, multiplication and division.
### <br/>
### 2) webopen
#### <br/>
#### The command webopen is used for opening a link in your default browser.
### <br/>
```py
from sherok import *
webopen("https://youtube.com/MrBeast6000/") # Change it into any link you want
```
### <br/>
#### We also have open_yt(), open_google(), open_newtab() and even rickroll()!!!!
#### Make sure to rickroll your friends.
### <br/>
### 3) Simple to Very Simple
### <br/>
#### We even converted simple python comands like print and input to very simpler commands like pr and ask.
#### <br/>
#### In normal python:
#### <br/>
```py
q = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello {q}")
```
#### <br/>
#### But in your library (Only 1 line is more, the importing code):
#### <br/>
```py
from sherok import *
q = ask("What is your name? ")
pr(f"Hello {q}")
```
#### <br/>
### 4) Wait
#### <br/>
#### In normal python:
#### <br/>
```py
import time
time.sleep(10)
print("Hi after 10 seconds")
```
#### <br/>
#### In Sherok:
#### <br/>
```py
from sherok import *
wait(10)
print("Hi after 10 seconds")
```
#### <br/>
### 5) Auto Stop
#### <br/>
#### We also have a command name pstop() which stands for program stop.
#### It will close the program after a time or at the time you run it.
#### <br/>
```py
from sherok import *
print(1)
wait(1)
print(2)
wait(1)
print(3)
wait(1)
print("I counted upto 3, now bye!")
wait(2)
pstop()
```
#### <br/>
### 6) Joke and fact
#### <br/>
#### Lemme show you the code of Jokes and Facts.
#### <br/>
#### We have 2 types of jokes here, programming joke and normal joke.
#### Both will need Internet.
#### <br/>
#### Code of Programming Joke:
```py
from sherok import *
joke = pjoke()
print(pjoke)
```
#### <br/>
#### Code of Normal Joke:
```py
from sherok import *
joke = joke()
print(pjoke)
```
#### <br/>
#### Facts can be also made offline.
#### <br/>
#### Here is the code for that:
#### <br/>
```py
from sherok import *
fact = fact()
print(fact)
```
### <br/>
### 7) Speak
### <br/>
#### This will only talk in the default voice type of your computer.
#### Maybe, it will be male or maybe female
### <br/>
#### The code:
### <br/>
```py
from sherok import *
talk("Sherok is an awesome library!")
```
### <br/>
### 8) Ranum
### <br/>
#### Ranum is something for getting a random number upto the nuber that you give.
### <br/>
#### Example:
### <br/>
```py
from sherok import *
ranum(15) # This will return a random number between 0 and 16.
```
### <br/>
